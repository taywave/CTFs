        <i>How I found the flag:</i><br></br>
        <p>After downloading the snooze file on my VM, I checked the file type. 
        It was a compressed file, so I ran the 'uncompress' command and output the result to a .txt file. Then, I read the file, which gave me the flag.  
        I was the first member of my team to solve this challenge.</p>
