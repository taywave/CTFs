## Stats
- Team: myself
- Rank: 2645/7084
- Challenges: 1/5
- Flags: 12/65

## Summary
This was my first real CFT competition.  
I had a few free hours over the weekend to see if I could capture some flags in the blue team competition, and I was able to complete the entire first challenge.
Although I didn't have any more time to work on the rest of the flags, I was satisfied that I had completed one of them, and more importantly, got some experience under my belt. 
While I couldn't work on the last challenges, I realize I have much to learn and many more skills to develop to solve the harder challenges. 
At some point, I want to go back and solve the rest of these since they are great learning opportunities.
The things I learned from this competition will certainly help me in the future. 

## Takeaways
- CFTs are fun yet tricky
- I enjoyed working on blue team tasks in a competitive environment
